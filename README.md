# Executive Summary


The aim of this project is to predict the quality of weight lifting exercises through classification of data from from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The project starts with exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, where 100 out of the 160 variables were neglected as they mostly had missing values. Then, three predictive models (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and Neural Networks) were built and an evaluation and comparison of their performance was presented. Though, all three models achieved near perfect accuracy (lowest model achieved 99.83 %) and all of them predicted the 20 cases in the validation data set correctly. However, Random Forest model was selected, because it has a higher tolerance to missing values and irrelevant attributes. In addition, it had great capability dealing with discrete, binary, continuous attributes and handles model parameters better than the other two algorithms.
